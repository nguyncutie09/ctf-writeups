# 📸 Screenshots for Easy Web Challenges – picoCTF 2025

This folder contains all image files used in the write-ups of easy-level web challenges.

Each image is referenced directly from its corresponding `.md` file inside `web/`.

## 📝 Naming Convention

Use the format:  
`[challenge-name]-[step].png`

For example:
- `cookie-monster-devtools.png`
- `cookie-monster-decode.png`

## 📌 Notes

- Keep screenshots small and focused (avoid full-screen if possible).
- Use descriptive names so the image is clearly linked to a specific step.
